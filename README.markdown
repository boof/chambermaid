Chambermaid
===========

Chambermaid acts as interpreter between Git repositories and Ruby objects.

The main objective of Chambermaid is not to mess with your classes or objects.
Instead Chambermaid should provide a simple but powerful API.

Chambermaid keeps diaries for identifiable ruby objects and writes pages for
each snapshot. Chambermaid browses theses diaries to find the right page for
your ruby object.
